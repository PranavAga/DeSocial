# Decentralized Social Media Platform

This project is an enhanced decentralized social media application that allows users to interact without restrictions, emphasizing community ownership over corporate control. It supports various social media interactions such as promoting/demoting, commenting, and following between multiple users. The platform leverages blockchain technology for decentralization and smart contracts for core functionalities.

## How to Run Locally

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Configure MetaMask

- **Install MetaMask**: Install the MetaMask browser extension if you haven't already.

- Change the network to Sepolia testnet and select the account which contains Sepolia ETH for testing (get them using faucets)
    
### 2. Install Front-End Dependencies

In the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### 7. Start the React Application

- **Run the Front-End App from the `frontend` directory**:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  - This will start the development server and open the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 8. Interact with the Application

- **Access the App**:

  - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

- **Connect MetaMask**:

  - When prompted, connect your MetaMask wallet to the application.

- **Use Features**:

  - Create new posts.
  - Comment on posts.
  - Promote and Demote posts.
  - Follow other users.
  - Donate to content creators.

## Additional Notes

- **Smart Contract Changes:** If you make changes to your smart contracts:

  - Recompile and redeploy them (you will need Alchemy API and private key for your sepolia wallet to redeploy))
  - Update the ABI in your front-end (`src/abis/SocialMedia.json`).
  - Update the contract address in your front-end code.

- **Hardhat vs. Create React App:** Hardhat is used for compiling and deploying smart contracts, while Create React App sets up your front-end React application.

- **Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are installed in the correct directories:

  - Root directory (`decentralized-social-media/`): Dependencies for smart contracts and deployment scripts (only for development).
  - Front-end directory (`frontend/`): Dependencies for the React application.
